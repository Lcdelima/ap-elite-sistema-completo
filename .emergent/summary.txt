The AI engineer successfully progressed the AP Elite application by addressing multiple critical user requests. Initially, the focus was on fixing blue screen errors and standardizing the UI across modules. Key actions included creating  frontend files and corresponding backend routers for Process Analysis, Contract Generator, Document Library, and Automated Reports, and integrating them into  and . A significant effort was made to update  to match a user-provided header design. The engineer debugged and fixed a dashboard data loading error in . Following this, a mass correction was applied to fix  imports causing blue screens in numerous frontend files. The latest task involves enhancing the Digital Forensics module, leading to the creation of  and , and is currently working on  in response to continued user feedback about module failures.

The overarching goal is to transform a basic ERP into a robust AP Elite application, incorporating cloud, E2E encryption, predictive AI, and hybrid database support. Specific requirements included integrating 15 AI-powered modules (RAG, audio/video analysis, Blockchain, advanced OCR) with their frontend counterparts. Immediate fixes were needed for Smart Fees 404, Dashboard JS errors, User Management API 500, and a Logout button. The financial module required reorganization into legal, forensics, administrative, and communication categories, with form fields needing proper placeholders and validations. Enhancements were explicitly requested for phone interceptions and process analysis, followed by a broad directive to implement all 20 functions from an operational manual across multiple development waves. A critical UI/UX overhaul was mandated to standardize module layouts with thematic categories, color-coding, consistent navigation buttons (back, save, cancel), and to resolve recurring blue screen errors in modules like Análise processual pro, Gerador de contratos, and Relatórios avançados. The Jurídico (Legal) module was targeted for comprehensive, advanced, and highly functional development. More recently, the user reiterated the need for header standardization across all modules based on provided images, asked for fixes for Gerador de documentos jurídicos, Biblioteca de documentos técnicos, Relatórios Automatizados (making them highly functional, robust, innovative, and modern), and repeatedly reported blue screen or not working issues for Análise Processual Pro, Análise Avançada Pro, and Perícia Digital Enhanced.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that Pericia digital enhaced esta sem funcionar (Digital forensics enhanced is not working) and showing a blue screen. In response, the engineer created a new frontend component: . This action is part of a broader effort to rebuild and enhance modules that the user identified as incomplete, failing, or displaying blue screens, ensuring they conform to the recently established standardized UI patterns, including consistent headers, buttons, colors, and fonts. The next immediate step in this specific task is to create the corresponding backend for this new  module.
