The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative and expansive development process driven by continuous user feedback and artifact uploads. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing and standardizing UI across existing modules, followed by creating advanced forensics modules like Perícia Digital Profissional and Interceptações Telemáticas Completa. A significant portion of the work involved responding to the user's explicit request to create revolutionary modules, repeatedly fueled by uploads of various forensic tools. The AI made multiple attempts to declare the system complete, but the user's persistent uploads led to the creation of five new backend modules and four new frontend components. A critical turning point was when the user provided specific bug reports (Perícia Digital incomplete, Mídia vs Média typo), shifting the AI from broad feature expansion to targeted fixes and deeper integration, particularly for Interceptação Telefônica and Extração de Dados, using high-benchmark tools like Cellebrite as a reference for superior functionality.

The overarching goal is to transform a basic ERP into a cutting-edge AP Elite application, a revolutionary digital forensics platform featuring cloud capabilities, E2E encryption, predictive AI, and hybrid database support. Key requirements include integrating numerous AI modules, fixing immediate issues (e.g., Smart Fees 404, Dashboard JS, User Management API 500, Logout), and reorganizing the financial module. UI/UX standardization is crucial for consistent layouts, thematic categories, and navigation. Urgent resolution was required for blue screen errors in various existing modules. The Jurídico module needed comprehensive development. Most critically, the user repeatedly requested the creation of revolutionary and innovative forensics and data extraction modules (Extração de Dados, Perícia Digital, Interceptações Telemáticas) that surpass commercial tools like Cellebrite, Oxygen, and Avila in functionality and completeness, including real-time interception. Recent explicit feedback highlighted issues with an incomplete and poorly made digital forensics module and a Mídia vs Média naming error, along with a directive to enhance Interceptação Telefônica to be highly functional, referencing the Guardião system. The latest directive is to implement data extraction improvements, using uploaded forensic software (including Cellebrite) as references to build a superior, cutting-edge module.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, using MongoDB as the database. The backend serves API routes, and the frontend consumes these APIs to render the user interface.



- ****: This file is central for API routing. It has been repeatedly modified to import and include routers for all newly created backend modules, ensuring their APIs are accessible.
- ****: This file defines the frontend routing. It has been updated multiple times to include new routes for the  components, making the new modules navigable in the UI.
- ****: This component provides a consistent layout for modules. It was identified as potentially needing modification to align with user's specific visual feedback, and some visual corrections were made (e.g., related to a missing Timeline icon).
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for the initial Ultra Extraction Pro module, tested to be 100% functional for various extraction methods and device categories.
- ****: **NEW file.** Frontend component for the Ultra Extraction Pro module.
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for password recovery functionalities.
- ****: **NEW file.** Frontend for password recovery.
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for advanced data recovery.
- ****: **NEW file.** Frontend for data recovery.
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for comprehensive USB forensics.
- ****: **NEW file.** Frontend for USB forensics.
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for browser and database forensics.
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for advanced telephony interceptions, designed to surpass the Guardião system.
- ****: **NEW file.** Backend for a new, Cellebrite-inspired Elite Data Extraction module.
- ****: This file is critical for tracking development, recording user problem statements, and logging testing results and agent communications. It has been updated to reflect the creation and testing status of new modules.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was instructed by the user to implemente as extrações de dados, usando os sofewer e programas como referencia e aprimore. This instruction was followed by the user uploading critical forensic tools, specifically Cellebrite UFED Setup and Cellebrite Physical Analyzer.

The AI engineer acknowledged these uploads as key references and committed to creating a data extraction module that would be superior to Cellebrite. The current work involves the creation of the backend file:

-   : This new Python file is intended to house the backend logic for a revolutionary Elite Data Extraction module, directly inspired and aiming to surpass the capabilities of the recently provided Cellebrite tools.

The backend file has just been successfully created. The next immediate step in the previous AI's thought process was to register this new router in  and then proceed to the frontend development. The last reported status before this summary request was Backend criado! Agora registro e finalizo:.
