The previous AI engineer effectively expanded the AP Elite application, initially fixing critical bugs like Smart Fees 404, Dashboard JS errors, and User Management API 500, while enhancing UX with a Logout button and reorganized financial modules. A significant effort was dedicated to implementing ONDA 1 (Executive Dashboard, Deadline Manager), which involved creating both backend and frontend components and integrating them. A major part of the work focused on a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, standardizing the application's layout, introducing thematic categories with color-coding, and creating a  for consistent navigation and actions across all modules. This involved creating new backend and frontend files, updating routes, and rigorous debugging of integration issues and Pydantic validation conflicts. The engineer also attempted to implement an Enhanced Phone Interceptions module, later upgrading it to a COMPLETE AND PROFESSIONAL version, though attempts to parse a provided user manual failed. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively working on fixing blue screen errors in several modules and standardizing their interfaces, particularly in the Jurídico (Legal) module, by creating new backend and frontend components.

The project aims to evolve a basic ERP into a comprehensive AP Elite application with cloud integration, E2E encryption, predictive AI, and hybrid database support. Key feature demands included 15 new AI-powered modules (RAG, audio/video analysis, Blockchain, advanced OCR) and corresponding frontend development. Recent fixes addressed Smart Fees 404, Dashboard JS errors, User Management API 500, and a Logout button addition. The financial module required reorganization by legal, forensics, administrative, and communication categories, with form fields needing placeholders and validations. Specific enhancements were requested for phone interceptions and process analysis, followed by a broad request to implement TUDO according to a 20-function operational manual across multiple waves. Subsequently, a full UI overhaul was requested to standardize module layouts by theme, color-code categories, ensure consistent navigation buttons (back, save, cancel), and address blue screen errors in modules like Análise processual pro, Gerador de contratos, and Relatórios avançados. The Jurídico module was explicitly targeted for comprehensive, advanced, and highly functional development.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively addressing user feedback regarding module errors and design standardization.
The last explicit action was deciding to correct all modules displaying a blue screen error and to standardize their layouts to match the new header and component patterns demonstrated in . This involves creating new, complete frontend versions for the affected modules and ensuring consistent interactive buttons, colors, fonts, and positioning across the application. Specifically, the engineer had just started creating the frontend for Gerador de Documentos as  and had begun investigating the  file, suspecting runtime errors for the tela azul issue, rather than file content problems. The goal is to make all modules innovative, modern, unique, and fully functional, adhering to the standardized design language established.
