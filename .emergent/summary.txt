The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned a basic ERP into a sophisticated application for AP Elite, starting with bug fixes and a hybrid data synchronization system. User requests rapidly escalated to a massive integration of advanced AI modules (orchestration, document management, OSINT, RAG, OCR, media analysis, blockchain, predictive analytics), with corresponding frontend development for 8 new pages. A significant bug-fixing cycle addressed Smart Fees 404, Dashboard JS errors, User Management API 500, and added a Logout button. Critical deployment issues (duplicate routers, password exposure, hardcoded URLs, CORS) were also tackled. The financial module was completely reorganized into categories. Form fields were enhanced with placeholders. Key investigation modules like Phone Interceptions and Process Analysis were upgraded to Enhanced versions. The user then requested tudo, leading to a multi-wave implementation plan, with ONDA 1 initiated (Executive Dashboard, Deadline Manager frontend/backend creation and integration). The trajectory concludes with the engineer initiating comprehensive frontend testing for all modules.

<product_requirements>
The project's core goal was to transform a basic ERP into a comprehensive AP Elite application with 18 initial modules. Key requirements included cloud integration, E2E encryption, predictive AI, and hybrid database support. Subsequent explicit demands led to a massive expansion, encompassing 15 new AI-powered features like RAG for PDFs, AI audio/video analysis, Blockchain for Chain of Custody, and advanced OCR, along with comprehensive frontend development. Recent fixes targeted Smart Fees 404, Dashboard JavaScript errors, User Management API 500, and the addition of a Logout button. The financial module needed layout reorganization by legal, forensics, administrative, and communication categories. Form fields across modules required clear labels, placeholders, and validations. Specific enhancements were requested for phone interceptions and process analysis, and then broadly all other functionalities. Finally, the user requested the full implementation of a detailed operational manual, covering 20 specific functionalities across multiple waves, and a comprehensive audit of the entire application for readiness.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the initial phase (ONDA 1) of a comprehensive plan to fulfill the user's request to implement TUDO. This phase focuses on critical management and control functionalities.

Specifically, the following actions were performed:
1.  **Creation of Backend Modules:**
    *    was created to serve as the backend for the executive dashboard.
    *    was created for deadline management functionalities.
2.  **Backend Integration:**
    *   Both new backend routers were successfully included in the main FastAPI application, , ensuring their API endpoints are accessible.
3.  **Creation of Frontend Pages:**
    *    was created for the executive dashboard user interface.
    *    was created for the deadline management user interface.
4.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Routes for  and  were added to  to enable navigation.
    *   Corresponding navigation cards for these new modules were integrated into , allowing users to access them from the main admin interface.
5.  **Service Restart and Verification:**
    *   All services ([2025-10-23T19:55:42.151Z] info  code-server 4.105.1 811ec6c1d60add2eb92446161ca812828fdbaa7f
[2025-10-23T19:55:42.152Z] info  Using user-data-dir /root/.local/share/code-server, , , ) were restarted to apply the changes.
    *   A quick screenshot was taken to verify that the  page was loading correctly in the frontend.
6.  **Initiation of Comprehensive Frontend Testing:** The AI engineer completed a backend audit (which revealed problems but were not fixed before the next step) and was preparing to launch a full frontend testing agent for all 45 modules to ensure 100% functionality and identify any remaining issues.
