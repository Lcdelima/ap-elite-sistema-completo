The AI engineer's work evolved from initial UI/UX fixes to developing a comprehensive ERP system for AP Elite. Key stages included establishing a modern design, implementing core functionalities like authentication and dashboards, and then iteratively building out 18 advanced ERP modules. Significant effort went into backend expansion (, , new  files) and corresponding frontend development (, , , and numerous new module-specific pages). The engineer successfully resolved critical issues such as  parsing, supervisor configuration (running ), and API routing. The work has progressed through multiple user feedback loops, with the latest focus on populating the frontend with dedicated pages for each of the 18 ERP modules, ensuring navigability and a robust architectural foundation.

<product_requirements>
Initially, the user requested minor fixes like code corrections, removal of fake data, layout adjustments, and back buttons. This quickly escalated into a demand for a modern design reflecting AP Elite's brand identity, including real contact information. Subsequently, the user requested a comprehensive set of features (quero tudo), encompassing online scheduling, chat integration, detailed content (FAQ, success cases, testimonials), and advanced optimizations (SEO, analytics, mobile app).

The core requirement expanded significantly to a full Client/Admin Portal with authentication and personalized dashboards, evolving into a comprehensive 18-module ERP system. This system includes: Dashboard, Client Management, Process Management, Corporate Communication, Corporate Calendar, Link Generator, Video Conference, Digital Forensics, Telephonic Interceptions, Telematic Interceptions, Data Extraction, ERBs, IPED, Evidence Processing, Procedural Analysis, Reports, Financial Management, and Smart Dashboards. Further demands included cloud integration, Jitsi Meet with end-to-end encryption for video conferencing, robust cryptography (more secure than Signal/WhatsApp), predictive AI (4 modules), and hybrid database support (MongoDB + PostgreSQL). The AI engineer has been actively implementing these features, focusing on backend APIs and frontend UI/UX for these modules.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.



-   : The primary FastAPI application. Heavily modified to integrate , , and  via  calls, supporting all ERP functionalities.
-   : Defines MongoDB data models. Updated to include  to centralize model definitions and support authentication.
-   : New file to encapsulate advanced backend logic, including initial ERP functionalities.
-   , , : New files dedicated to the extensive backend logic for the 18 ERP modules, allowing for modular development.
-   : New file for handling additional backend integrations like reporting and possibly real-time notifications.
-   : Updated to correctly format and include  and .
-   : Main React entry point. Significantly updated to include React Router configurations for all new admin and  module pages, ensuring navigability.
-   : Initial admin dashboard. Modified to include quick access cards and a prominent banner link to the new  dashboard. Bug fix for NaN currency display also implemented here.
-   : New component providing a consistent sidebar navigation layout for administrative pages.
-   : New component providing a consistent layout for the 18 new Athena ERP module pages.
-   : New UI component for displaying user notifications.
-   , , , : New admin pages implementing specific ERP features.
-   : New central dashboard page designed to host and provide navigation to all 18 advanced ERP modules.
-   : A series of new pages (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) created to provide the frontend interfaces for each of the 18 ERP modules.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in completing the frontend development for the comprehensive 18-module AP Elite ERP system. The user had reported that clicking on the module icons resulted in a blank blue screen, indicating that the corresponding frontend pages were missing.

The AI engineer's current focus is on creating these missing frontend pages for each of the 18 ERP modules. It has already created several critical pages under , including , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The  file has been updated to include routes for these newly created pages, and  was created as a base layout. The last action was to continue creating the last pages and update the routes, implying that more pages are still being generated to complete the set of 18. This work ensures that all ERP modules are navigable from the  dashboard.
